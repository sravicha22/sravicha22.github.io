# Plots Using Altair, A few Ways

## Directly from Vega Editor


I can download a JSON specification from the [Vega-Editor](https://vega.github.io/editor/) and save it in `assets/json` folder.

<vegachart schema-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/json/fromEditor.json" style="width: 100%"></vegachart>

## Using Altair to make the plot

The following plot was generated with a URL link to the data:
<vegachart schema-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/json/altair_mobilityURL.json" style="width: 100%"></vegachart>


### With data included

The following plot was generated by using the full dataframe:
<vegachart schema-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/json/altair_mobility.json" style="width: 100%"></vegachart>


### With data remotely hosted
